Free Retrospective Meetings App.

Retrospective (English 'retrospective' and Latin 'retrospectare', "looking back") generally means looking behind the events that have occurred.
This application provides that below:
  Enables Agile teams to have effective conversations, discover new insights, and generate action plans by using different retrospective models.
  Has so many formats that teams will never have the same meeting twice. Team members can follow one of the industry-tested sprint retrospective example that perfectly fits the team. It’s simple to gather feedback asynchronously or in real time, so there’s always time to look back and move forward.
  Uses industry best practices to walk your team through an engaging retrospective from start to finish. As the team moves from gathering data to deciding what to do, everyone can follow along and collaborate towards the same goal. With all the teammates participating in a powerful conversation, it’s clear why retrospectives are the key to continuous improvement.
  Enables to organize the teammates and all retrospective documentation in one place. The team can ensure psychological safety with private rooms, and everyone can share feedback openly because comments are anonymous. It’s easy to explore previous meeting details and review completed retrospectives.
  
  Start Stop Continue Retrospective is a simple technique for an action-oriented retrospective meeting that encourages participants to come up with practical ideas for team-based improvement and action items you implement right away. Look back at the last sprint (stop & continue) while also looking forward to the next sprint (start doing). This retrospective technique is based around three primary questions - what should we start doing? what should we stop doing? and what should we continue doing? Before the retrospective begins, the facilitator (Kanban/Scrum Master) should select the Start Stop Continue technique from retrospective template page after by clicking the create room button. 
  - Start List: Things that the team thinks would have a positive impact on the team that aren't already implemented. 
  - Stop List: Things within the team’s workflow or process that aren’t helping the team to achieve their goals and should be stopped. 
  - Continue List: Things that are already worked well in the previous iteration and should stay in the workflow.
  
  Mad Sad Glad is a popular Agile retrospective technique that promotes emotional well-being by encouraging team members to consider ways to improve morale and create a positive team environment. While “old school” corporate practices might have promoted hiding your emotions at work, this retrospective exercise gives teams the opportunity to let them fly! If you want to learn how the team feels after the previous sprint, Mad Sad Glad is a straightforward option that is easy to explain and run. Use the Mad Sad Glad retrospective template to check on the team's emotional wellbeing. Allow the team members to analyze the positive and negative emotions they may have experienced during past projects. It will allow you to build a positive team dynamic that will improve communication and increase productivity in the long run.
  - Mad: Things that the team found frustrating in the last iteration
  - Sad: Things that the team found disappointing in the last iteration
  - Glad: Things that made the team happy and excited in the last iteration
